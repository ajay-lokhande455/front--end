    <h2>Hocky Rules</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a field hockey match, two teams with 11 players each, use specially designed sticks to play for an hour and score goals to win a contest. </li>
        <li>With roots dating back to 500 BC, the origin of field hockey can be traced to the early civilizations of Ancient Greece and Egypt.</li>
        <li>There are primitive drawings and carvings on walls that depict people playing with a ball and a stick, showing striking resemblance with modern-day hockey.</li>
        <li>However, the hockey that we see today has witnessed radical changes and the modern game is played in accordance with a set of rules and regulations formulated by the custodians of the game.</li>
        <li>Players are only allowed to use the flat side of the stick to touch the ball. Failure to do so leads to a foul (backstick) and the ball is given to the opposition.</li>
    </ol>
